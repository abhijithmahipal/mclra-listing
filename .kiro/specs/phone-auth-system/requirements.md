# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a phone number and OTP-based authentication system with house-based authorization for the resident management application. The system will distinguish between heads of family (who can manage house details) and regular members (who can only view resident information). Authentication is handled through Firebase Phone Authentication, with users automatically assigned roles based on whether they create a new house or join an existing one.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user with a phone number, I want to authenticate using OTP so that I can access the application securely without needing to remember passwords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their phone number THEN the system SHALL send an OTP via SMS
2. WHEN a user enters a valid OTP THEN the system SHALL authenticate them successfully
3. WHEN a user enters an invalid OTP THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
4. WHEN an OTP expires THEN the system SHALL allow the user to request a new OTP
5. IF a phone number is not registered THEN the system SHALL redirect to the registration flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user who is a head of family, I want to register my house and become the head of family so that I can manage all residents in my house.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new phone number completes OTP verification THEN the system SHALL redirect to registration page
2. WHEN registering THEN the system SHALL require a house number input
3. WHEN a house number is provided THEN the system SHALL validate it is alphanumeric or number (eg. some are 96 or 96A)
4. WHEN registration is completed THEN the system SHALL create a new house record with the user as head of family
5. WHEN registration is completed THEN the system SHALL redirect to the add home page to enter house details
6. IF a house number already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new user who wants to join an existing house, I want to select my house from available options so that I can become a member and view resident details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new phone number completes OTP verification THEN the system SHALL show options to create new house or join existing house
2. WHEN choosing to join existing house THEN the system SHALL display a list of available houses
3. WHEN selecting an existing house THEN the system SHALL add the user as a member (not head of family)
4. WHEN joining is completed THEN the system SHALL redirect to the house page showing all residents
5. WHEN joining is completed THEN the user SHALL NOT have access to add/edit resident functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a head of family, I want to manage residents in my own house so that I can add, edit, and maintain accurate information for my family members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a head of family logs in THEN the system SHALL grant access to the add home page for their house only
2. WHEN a head of family views their own house page THEN the system SHALL display add/edit controls for residents
3. WHEN a head of family accesses add home functionality THEN the system SHALL allow full CRUD operations on residents in their house only
4. WHEN a head of family views other houses THEN the system SHALL display residents in read-only mode
5. WHEN a head of family tries to edit residents from other houses THEN the system SHALL deny access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As any authenticated user (head of family or member), I want to view resident details from all houses so that I can see information about all residents in the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authenticated user logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect to the houses page showing all houses
2. WHEN any authenticated user views the houses page THEN the system SHALL display all houses and their residents
3. WHEN any authenticated user clicks on a house THEN the system SHALL show all residents in that house
4. WHEN a house member (non-head) views any house page THEN the system SHALL display residents in read-only mode
5. WHEN a house member tries to access add home functionality THEN the system SHALL deny access and show unauthorized message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to be automatically redirected to the houses page so that I can quickly access all community information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any existing user logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect to the houses page showing all houses
2. WHEN a user's session is valid THEN the system SHALL not require re-authentication
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the session and redirect to login page
5. WHEN a head of family wants to edit their house THEN the system SHALL provide access to add home functionality for their house only

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle authentication state properly so that I have a seamless experience across page refreshes and navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain their authentication state
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access protected pages THEN the system SHALL redirect to login
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI accordingly
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost during authentication THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN Firebase authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
